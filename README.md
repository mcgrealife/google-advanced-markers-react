# Google maps Advanced Markers preview in a React application

## source: `pages/examples`

- basic prop-drilling example following outdated google maps documentation
- simpler example using zustand managed context (preferred)
- cluster example using supercluster package (which is what the official https://www.npmjs.com/package/@googlemaps/markerclusterer package uses â€“ though this package does not support advanced markers yet).
